## Camera Trap Classification

Automatic identification of animals within camera trap images or videos. 





The authors recommend a two-step approach using Microsoft's 'MegaDector' object detector to first identify potential animals and then using a second classification model trained on the species of interest. 

MegaDetector can obtained from
